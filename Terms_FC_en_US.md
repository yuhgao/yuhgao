# Terms for using works by Yuhgao for Fanmade Creations (FCs)

### We ask you to follow these terms:

- **Do not make profit from the fanmade creations (FCs) in any ways.**
    - This does NOT include video monetization programs like Youtube and memberships like patreon.
        - If the work contains “any kind of data from the original work”—like non-arranged, original music tracks or original artworks—, then **do not make any payment walls to reach those FCs** (excluding the overall software or something)**.**
    - We do not limit “fully fan-made creations” being sold to fill the cost producing the FCs.
        - Any “creative-enough” works without any kind of the original data can be sold (to sustain your creative work).
    - Don’t use the work as an official of a commercial group, even if it’s completely free. First contact the rights’ holder, Yuhgao.
- **You must credit each creator for their work properly:** you may have to credit the artist of the artworks, for example, when you want to use the artwork.
- **You must clarify that the FCs are fanmade.** Do not let them mislead people to think the FCs are official.
- **Please properly obtain the music data from official sources,** such as CDs or Free DLs. No ripping from games and Youtube/Soundcloud/Other!
- **Do not make any "bad-mannered" works:** offensive, rude, or something that can ruin the work's image.
    - Use signs (and upload settings for SNSs) properly to avoid unwanted interaction with some genres of productions (i.e. R-18G).
- **Make "creative" works:** *"Too poor in creativity"* work, like only transposing and speed-ups of the music, are heavily discouraged.
    - Changing BPMs and keys for DJing is allowed; but don't upload those tweaked data online!
- We will be happy if the content has a link to the original track/album page.
- FCs should be published in accordance with these terms (inheritance). However, if issues arise with these derivative works (such as reselling), it is generally the responsibility of the derivative work's author to address them.
    - This matter does not restrict the rights of the original creator or imply that they should not address such issues.
- If you have a question, feel free to ask Yuhgao.

### **Note that:**

- These terms only apply to works which the rights are owned by **Yuhgao, "Aoirohoukiboshi", and "hexatropica.".** Although most of our work are under these terms, but please refer to the holder of rights if the work does not belong to us, like other label-related tracks and music exclusive in rythm games.
    - VOCALOIDs and other software-vocalists’ songs usually have their orignal rules for the softwares and characters. Please refer to those rules, too.
- If the work has somebody else with Yuhgao as an author, **you must gain permission from all of the contributors.** Or in other words, you must follow every rules for each creator.
    - For “Aoirohoukiboshi” works, **all music (including other composers’ work) and all illustrations from the albums/CDs are under Yuhgao’s rights** (and the **Terms**), but the **“The Star Seekers” comics/videos and all live streams of Youtube** are not. Do not use those content as a source, without the author’s permission.
        - Yes, “Continuum” (by tsuki), “Wanderer of the Purgatory” (w/tsuki and MoAI) and “empty sense” (by Fl00t) are under the **terms**.
- **The rules may change without any announcements.** Please refer to the newest revision of this page when you upload a work.
    - We normally do not retroactively apply new terms to old works before update, but we may individually request modifications or removal of the FC with appropriate reasons.
- If there is a conflict between the Japanese version of this document, the Japanese document should be refered.

Thank you for reading and following these rules. We sincerly appreciate any kind of work under these terms, and we wish that our work can help your creative life.

**Yuhgao**
